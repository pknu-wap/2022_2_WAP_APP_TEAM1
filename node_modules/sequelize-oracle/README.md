Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js/io.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

### Note
sequelize-oracle is a fork of [sequelize@master](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/tree/master)  
This fork add support of DML statements for Oracle  
If you don't need Oracle support, prefer the original [Sequelize](http://sequelizejs.com/)  
  
Sequelize-oracle@3.0.1-x.x is in development. Only the old version (1.7.10-x.x) is on npmjs registry.  

## Compatibility:
Sequelize-oracle is compatible only with nodejs@0.10 and nodejs@0.12 (with oracledb >= 0.6).  
Sequelize-oracle is only tested with Oracle 11 XE and nodejs@0.10
  
## Installation

The basic install steps are:

- Install oracledb
  - Install the small, free [Oracle Instant Client](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-100365.html) libraries if your database is remote, or have a local database such as the free [Oracle XE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/overview/index.html) release.
  - Run `npm install oracledb` to install from the NPM registry.

  See [INSTALL](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.

- Install sequelize-oracle
  - Run `npm install sequelize-oracle` to install from the NPM registry.

## Oracledb config in Sequelize-Oracle
  - With Oracledb, the maximum number of rows that are fetched by select query is 100 rows. You can change this parameter with options.maxRows in each query.  
  - In Sequelize, for Raw query, the outFormat parameter for oracledb is OBJECT.  
  - AutoCommit is enable by default. If you don't want autoCommit, use Sequelize Transactions for manage commit et rollback.  


## Limitations:

- DataType: only this dataTypes are managed: 
  - STRING (=VARCHAR2)
  - CHAR
  - DECIMAL (=NUMBER)
  - BIGINT (=NUMBER(19,0))
  - INTEGER
  - FLOAT 
  - DOUBLE
  - UUID (=CHAR 36)
  - DATE (=TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE)
  - DATEONLY (=DATETIME) 
  - BOOLEAN (=NUMBER(1))
- Index: index type is not fully managed
  
## Todo:
- ENUM DataType
- improve index for type
- resolve the pb "name column length > 30 char" in nesteed querry
- ...
